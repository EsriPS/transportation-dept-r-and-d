Simple test harness used to assess users sign in status, available/related props and their availability. Also an example of the APP_CONFIG_PROCESSOR extension point implementation.

Note: only one extension implementation is supported for this extension point (if you try to enable for 2-n, the first widget added to the experience will be the one used)
